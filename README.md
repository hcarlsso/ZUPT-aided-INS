# ZUPTaidedINS

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the OpenShoe Matlab Implemenation. The
OpenShoe Matlab Implementation is a Matlab script (library) for processing
inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using a Kalma filter based zero-velocity
aided inertial navigation system algorithm. The main (skeleton) file that
should be called to run the algorithm is [main.m](main.m). All settings for the
algorithm are done in the file [settings.m](settings.m). The processing of the data is
done by the functions `zero_velocity_detector` and `ZUPTaidedINS`, located
in the files [zero_velocity_detector.m](zero_velocity_detector.m) and [ZUPTaidedINS.m](ZUPTaidedINS.m), respectively.
The result from running the algorithm is plotted by calling the script
[view_data.m](view_data.m).

##  The zero-velocity aided inertial navigation algorithm

The zero-velocity aided inertial navigation system algorithm is
implemented using a complimentary feedback filtering structure. That is,
the inertial navigation system works as the backbone of the system and
a Kalman filter is used to estimate (track) the perturbations (errors)
in the inertial navigation system. When a zero-velocity observation
is done, the Kalman filter estimates the current perturbations (errors)
in the navigation state estimate of the inertial navigation system; the
estimated perturbations are feedback into the inertial navigation system
to correct its internal states. The user can choose between four
different state space models to be used in the Kalman filter. The
default model is a nine state model, having the position, velocity, and
attitude perturbations as states.  The user can then choose between
adding sensor biases errors and/or scale factors errors as additional
states to the default model.

To determine when a zero-velocity update should be applied in the Kalman
filter, a zero-velocity detection algorithm is used. The zero-velocity
detection algorithm monitors the signal measured by the inertial
measurement unit, and based upon the prior information about the signal
at different motion dynamics it chooses between the hypotheses that the
navigation system is stationary or is moving. The user can choose
between four different zero-velocity detection algorithms,
the [SHOE](GLRT.m) detector, the [acceleration moving variance](MV.m)
detector, the [acceleration magnitude](MAG.m) detector, and the
[angular rate energy](ARE.m) detector. Details about these detectors
can be found in the papers:

2. [Evaluation of Zero-Velocity Detectors for Foot-Mounted Inertial Navigation Systems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2010.5646936)

## Algorithm settings and configurations

All settings for the algorithm and the inertial measurement data file
that should be used are controlled from the function settings.m. The
default settings are such that the algorithm produces a good output
when processing, the with the program, provided inertial measurement
unit data and with the default state space model. For other data sets or when using
the higher order state space models the settings may have to be tuned in
order for the algorithm to produce a good result. Information on how to
tune the system can be found in the paper

## The inertial measurement unit data

The inertial measurement unit data that comes with the OpenShoe Matlab
Implementation code has been recorded using a MicroStrain 3DX-GX2 inertial
measurement unit, with a dynamic range of +-18g and 1200 deg/s, and a
sample rate of 250 Hz. The inertial measurement unit was mounted in the
sole of the right side shoe of the user, and the user was walking in a
closed loop trajectory where he returned to his starting position within
+-1 cm. The gate speed for the different data sets are 5 km/h and 7 km/h.
